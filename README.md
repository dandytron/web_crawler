This a Web Crawler in JavaScript using Node.js! 

To rank well in Google Search, websites need to internally link pages one to another. 

For example, a blog post about the benefits of cheap haircuts should probably have a link to my other blog post about the best places to get haircuts.

This project had me write a JavaScript application that generates an "internal links" report for any website on the internet by crawling each page of the site.

Ideas for extending the project
  Make the script run on a timer and deploy it to a server. Have it email you every so often with a report
  Add more robust error checking so that you can crawl larger sites without issues
  Count external links, as well as internal links, and add them to the report
  Save the report as a CSV spreadsheet rather than printing it to the console
  Use a graphics library to create an image that shows the links between the pages as a graph visualization
  Make requests concurrently to speed up the crawling process
  Add a README.md file explaining to users how to clone your git repo and get started
